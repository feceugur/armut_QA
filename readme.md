## How to use?
1. Install Python3.x and pip
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. You can run `armut.feature` for the tests

#Note-2: Chromedrive version is so important for the run. If you haven't google chrome or 96.0.4664 version probably you get an error. Maybe we can dockerize this project or we can use the remote driver.
